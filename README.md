# An MDP solver for Pacman

The files that I wrote in exclusively is mdpAgents.py; the rest of the materials are from Berkeley's Cs188x AI course (so I claim no credit for them).

To run, download the files and move to the directory where the base files are in, and run `python pacman.py -p mdpAgent -l mediumClassic`
